# Welcome!

My name is Elizabeth Teas, and I am a dual-title PhD student in Human Development and Family Studies and Gerontology at Purdue University. My research focuses on identifying biopsychosocial processes that impact health and understanding how these processes develop over the life course. I am currently funded by an NIH NRSA F31 fellowship from the National Institute on Aging (1F31AG072824-01). This project uses an interdisciplinary approach to examine whether social connectedness across the life course predicts functional capacity in later life by promoting physical activity and/or reducing inflammatory biomarkers, and whether socioeconomic status modifies these pathways.

I am currently working under the advisement of Dr Elliot Friedman. For more information on my research interests and projects, check out my Research page!

Outside of the lab, I am an avid runner and traveler. I love all things related to cats, sports, and the outdoors.
