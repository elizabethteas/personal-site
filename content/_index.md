# Welcome!

My name is Elizabeth Teas, and I am a dual-title PhD student in Human Development and Family Studies and [Gerontology](https://www.purdue.edu/aging/) at Purdue University. My research focuses on identifying biopsychosocial processes that impact health and understanding how these processes develop over the life course. I am currently funded by an NIH NRSA F31 fellowship from the National Institute on Aging (1F31AG072824-01). This project uses an interdisciplinary approach to examine whether social connectedness across the life course predicts functional capacity in later life by promoting physical activity and/or reducing inflammatory biomarkers, and whether socioeconomic status modifies these pathways. I am currently working under the advisement of [Dr. Elliot Friedman](https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/elliot-friedman/). 

Outside of the lab, I am an avid runner and traveler. I love all things related to cats, sports, and the outdoors!
