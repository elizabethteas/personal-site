# Welcome!

My name is Elizabeth Teas, and I am a quantitative researcher / social scientist. I am currently a Research Scientist at Far Harbor in Austin, TX, where I study the impact of education interventions and policies. I completed a dual-title PhD in Human Development and Family Studies and [Gerontology](https://www.purdue.edu/aging/) at Purdue University in 2023. I am passionate about improving the health, education, and well-being of individuals, families, and the aging population through interdisciplinary research. My graduate research focused on identifying biopsychosocial processes that impact health and understanding how these processes develop over the life course. I was funded by an NIH NRSA F31 fellowship from the National Institute on Aging (1F31AG072824-01), and I worked under the advisement of [Dr. Elliot Friedman](https://hhs.purdue.edu/directory/elliot-friedman/). 

Outside of the lab, I am an avid runner, traveler, and outdoors-enthusiast! Feel free to explore my website and donâ€™t hesitate to reach out.
